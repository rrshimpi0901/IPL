Welcome to the IPL Power BI Dashboard project! ðŸš€

Introduction
This GitHub repository houses an interactive IPL (Indian Premier League) dashboard created using Power BI. Dive into the world of cricket statistics and gain insights from IPL seasons spanning from 2008 to 2022. This dashboard is a comprehensive visualization of IPL data, including winners, leading run-scorers (Orange Cap winners), leading wicket-takers (Purple Cap winners), and the number of boundaries (6's and 4's) hit in each season.

What's Inside
Data Source: The dashboard is powered by data imported from PostgreSQL. I've collected and organized IPL data from 2008 to 2022 to provide you with a comprehensive view of the tournament's history.

Visualization: I've used various visual elements, including cards, stacked bar charts, slicers, DAX calculations, and donut charts, to present the data in an engaging and informative way.

Insights: Explore the winners of each IPL season, discover who won the Orange Cap (top run-scorer) and Purple Cap (leading wicket-taker), and analyze the number of 6's and 4's hit in each season. These insights offer a deeper understanding of IPL trends and player performances.

How to Use
Data Import: If you wish to replicate this dashboard with your own data, follow the data import process outlined in the repository. Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and configured.
